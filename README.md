# Small Deflate
SDeflate is a small bare bone lossless compression library in ANSI C (ISO C90)
that implements the Deflate (RFC 1951) compressed data format specification standard.

SDeflate is mainly tuned to get as much speed and compression ratio from as little code
as needed to keep the implementation as concise as possible. In addition since
this library implements the Deflate standard some limitations including a small
match window of only 32kb apply. So don't expect comparable speed or compression
ratio to some of the newer algorithms.

## Features
- Portable single header and source file duo written in ANSI C (ISO C90)
- Small ~300 LoC implementation (Deflate: 170 LoC, Inflate: 150 LoC)
- 8 configurable compression level
- Dual license with either MIT or public domain
- Webassembly:
    - Deflate ~3.7 KB (~2.2KB compressed)
    - Inflate ~3.6 KB (~2.2KB compressed)

## Usage
For deflating add sdefl(.h+.c) into your project and include `sdefl.h`. To actually
compress memory first call `sdefl_bound` to calculate the maximum number of compressed
output and allocate an compress output memory buffer and pass it along with your
to compress input data and a compression level between `SDEFL_LVL_MIN` and
`SDEFL_LVL_MAX` to the main compression function `sdeflate`.

For inflating add sinfl(.h+.c) into your project and include `sinfl.h`. To
decompress a previously compressed block of memory call `sinflate`. Pass
your compressed block along with its size and an allocated output buffer
with size of the uncompressed block.
